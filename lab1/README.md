Note
======
Each solution works independently as a single file.

Compile and execute
=====================
No rocket science in compile and exec commands. Just the usual command with Wall flag.

For pro-man.c, ipc-pipe.c
```
gcc -Wall -o file.o file.c
```


For the rest
```
gcc -Wall -o file.o file.c -lrt
```
